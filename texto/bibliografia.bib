This chapter walks the reader through developing a good project from research to execution. The chapter also discusses ways scholars can build a Digital Humanities project with little technical knowledge. By emphasizing praxis, I demonstrate that the way to change culture begins with changing the system.},

Whereas a more traditional approach to data visualization would seek to answer questions or create clearer explanations through the process of visualization, code/art visualizations instead aim to provoke further questions, such as those about the societal tensions between surveillance and privacy in the case study. In addition to explicating the underlying Digital Humanities methods associated with such a practice, this chapter offers a step-by-step guide showing how the Aperveillance project was created using the p5.js programming language.},
